However, the increasing wages of on-campus learning leads to an increasing need for an alternate way of learning. With the outbreak of COVID-19, people needed to stay at home for safety. Therefore, finding an answer to this need became more dominant. Another major problem, especially in the ongoing decade, is the lack of enough cybersecurity knowledge by the common folk. This paper aims to look at a new platform that is carefully designed to teach cybersecurity to learners with any background. We design this system using gamification to increase the efficiency of learning. Because modern technologies are ubiquitous in our lives, particularly during the coronavirus outbreak, including practical work in teaching will be quite beneficial. The practical activity has a clear advantage, such as promoting experimental learning and improving student abilities and skills for the future professional career. Finally, we assess this method with a classic learning approach using two different groups.","tags":[],"title":"UltraLearn: Next-Generation CyberSecurity Learning Platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ghazaleh Shirvani","Saeid Shirazi","Behzad Beigzadeh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638835200,"objectID":"07b4fc4c3c9fc5152211a5649500a3dc","permalink":"https://ghazalehshirvani.github.io/publication/iotshield/","publishdate":"2021-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iotshield/","section":"publication","summary":"The widespread deployment of sensors and linked items contributes to the rising interest in the Internet-of-Things (IoT). These are used in conjunction with other Online services to develop highly sophisticated and profitable cloud-based services. Despite significant attempts to secure them, security management remains a crucial problem for these devices, Because of their intricacy, heterogeneous nature, and resource constraints. This paper presents IoT-Shield, a data mining technique that coincides with a process mining approach for identifying misbehavior in of the kind. IoT-Shield enables the characterization of IoT devices' behavioral models and the detection of possible threats, even in the presence of diverse protocols and platforms. The underlying architecture and components are then described and formalized, and a proof-of-concept prototype is detailed. A real-world traffic dataset known as KDD-NSL is used to evaluate the performance of our technique in a series of comprehensive trials. We conclude that XGBoost is the best available data mining algorithm for the IoT DDoS prediction method. We highlight how consolidating process mining with data mining helps in covering heterogeneity and lowering the computational burden.","tags":[],"title":"IoT-Shield: A Novel DDoS Detection Approach for IoT-Based Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saeid Shirazi","Ghazaleh Shirvani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1621382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621382400,"objectID":"1c6138b4a7fa0098e458613d2465fae3","permalink":"https://ghazalehshirvani.github.io/publication/mcgan/","publishdate":"2021-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mcgan/","section":"publication","summary":"Creating games is a costly process involving tons of vigorous efforts, time, and resources. Different game engines were introduced to facilitate the game-making process, such as Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot. However, despite the advent of game engines, the vacuum of automatically creating new games by computers was still felt. With artificial intelligence (AI) development and its growing presence in the industry, game developers made a new game development branch using AI. One of the essential steps in this context was the introduction of GameGAN, which inspired us for this article. Here we propose Multi-Class GamgeGan(MC-GAN), a starting point for the next generation of game engines based on GameGAN. In addition, MC-GAN is capable of classifying each desired game element and even changing its class to change the element’s nature (e.g., MC-GAN can change static elements to dynamic ones …","tags":[],"title":"MC-GAN: A Reimplementation of GameGAN With a Gaming Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saeid Shirazi","Ghazaleh Shirvani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614729600,"objectID":"76c65b230f91b9baa6b26f219e4fd966","permalink":"https://ghazalehshirvani.github.io/publication/gitcbot/","publishdate":"2021-03-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gitcbot/","section":"publication","summary":"Online Social Networks (OSNs) attracted millions of users in the world. OSNs made adversaries more passionate to create malware variants to subvert the cyber defence of OSNs. Through various threat vectors, adversaries persuasively lure OSN users into installing malware on their devices at an enormous scale. One of the most horrendous forms of named malware is OSNs' botnets that conceal C\u0026C information using OSNs' accounts of unaware users. In this paper, we present GITC (Ghost In The Cloud), which uses Telegram as a C\u0026C server to communicate with threat actors and access targets' information in an undetectable way. Furthermore, we present our implementation of GITC. We show how GITC uses the encrypted telegram Application Programming Interface (API) to cover up records of the adversary connections to the target, and we discuss why current intrusion detection systems cannot detect GITC …","tags":[],"title":"GITCBot: A Novel Approach for the Next Generation of C\u0026C Malware","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
